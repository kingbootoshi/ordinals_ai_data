Overview of Blob:
The Blob Ordinals project is a unique and complex collection on the Bitcoin blockchain. Without a centralized hub for information, interested parties must navigate a blend of social media elements – including the Book of Blob, the Blob Army, and the hashtag #SendBlob – to uncover the essence of the project.

Distinctive Features of Blob:
- **Bitcoin-Based Inscription**: Blobs are directly inscribed on the Bitcoin blockchain via the Ordinals protocol, ensuring robust security and permanence.
- **Viral Popularity**: The collection has gained notable traction, becoming a top-10 Bitcoin collection on Magic Eden.
- **Innovative Technology**: The project employs advanced technologies such as parent-child inscriptions, recursive inscriptions, and is built with React Three Fiber and custom shader code.

Collection History and Associated Projects:
- **Founders**: Created by Nuro, an artist and physician-turned-crypto enthusiast, and Eloc, who provided technical expertise. Other contributors include ordinalHO, Steaktoshi, and Boppleton.
- **Origins**: The founders first collaborated on Cypherpunk Ghosts and developed Cypherpunk Lab. Nuro's Nuro Realm project, featuring his own brain data inscribed on-chain, also influenced the creation of Blobs.
