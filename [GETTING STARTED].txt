There are chrome extension web wallets as well which are easier for the user experience, such as Unisat, Xverse and Leather.
UNISAT WALLET: https://unisat.io/ (ideal for BRC-20)
Xverse WALLET: https://www.xverse.app/ (ideal for collecting inscriptions)
Unisat and Xverse are great, ordinals compatible wallets which you install on chrome, allowing you to connect to marketplaces and verification services.Ord and Sparrow wallet do not have browser compatibility.

  Go to the "Receive" section of your chosen wallet.
  Transfer Bitcoin (BTC) from a cryptocurrency exchange (CEX) to your wallet address.
