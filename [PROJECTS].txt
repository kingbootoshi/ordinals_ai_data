[BTC DEGODS]
BTC DeGods are an obvious first. DeGods were the first project to purchase an entire block, so that they could launch the entire Ordinal collection from that single block. DeGods aren’t an original Ordinals collection, by the way. 

The original DeGods are from Solana. In total, 10,000 gods were minted at the start, but the team had imposed what came to be known as the Paperhands B*tch Tax (PHBT). In short, a tax of 33.3% was levied to sellers if they listed their god under the floor price and it sold. 

All 535 of these gods were consequently burned, and left for dead thanks to the PHBT… until now. In March, the team decided to bring the burned gods back to Bitcoin, the mother chain. The current floor price for BTC DeGods is 1.2 BTC, by the way. (For reference, the mint cost 0.33 BTC!)

[OMB/ORDINAL MAXI BIZ]
Ordinal Maxi Biz (OMB) took the Ordinal space by storm and by surprise when it first came on the scene. zk-Shark, the founder, quit his job on Wall Street to launch the anarchist-themed project. 

The project is split into 3 collections: Blue eyes, Red eyes, and the latest, Green eyes. For context, the originals reached an ATH of roughly 4.2 BTC, and the Green eyes collection kicked off the mint at 0.09 BTC. 

The collection launched with a guerrilla marketing campaign encouraging other projects to purchase and burn CryptoPunks, an act considered sacrilege by many (and highly befitting of an anarchist project). 

Two projects participated: DeGods and Bitcoin Bandits, both of which won 33 whitelist allocations each. Most of these spots were raffled off. In other words, OMB has already made history via the punk burning, and the project didn’t have to spend a single sat from its own funds.

[Bitcoin Bandits]
Bitcoin Bandits is an OG project on Bitcoin. The bandits have a community on Bitcoin unlike any other. The only other community that’s even close to bringing this kind of meme energy is Sappy Seals, and they’re on Ethereum. 

Chartfu, the Bandits’ fearless leader, is a no-nonsense founder. As CDO of Magic Eden, he was instrumental in the company’s pivot to Ordinals. (Rumor is, he had threatened to walk out if they didn’t pivot.) He was also one of the chief organizers of the cryptopunk burn for both the Bitcoin Bandits and Bitcoin DeGods. (A walking win.)

[NULLISH]
Undoubtedly the most legendary OG sat hunter, Nullish had teamed up early with zk-Shark and other Bitcoiners in the space to devise and push the rare sat narrative. Today, Nullish’s collections comprise abstract art pieces that are inscribed on rare sats. 

Holders of all 5 of the main Nullish pieces across Bitcoin and Ethereum received 8 whitelist spots each from the OMB Green eyes mint (and they didn’t even have to burn a punk!).

[Bitcoin Frogs]
Bitcoin Frogs is the first 10,000-piece Ordinal project to have sold out via a free mint on the Lightning Network. The Bitcoin Frogs were instrumental in spearheading the space because they made people believe that a massively organic community on Bitcoin was possible. 

The free mint helped onboard many people who wanted to own an Ordinal, but didn't have the means, nor the knowledge or capital, to do so. The frogs community banded together to execute a concerted campaign. The campaign’s mission? To onboard as many people onto Ordinals as possible, and not just from the native Bitcoin community, but from Ethereum and Solana as well. 

And they accomplished this goal with the most hands-on approach imaginable. 

Accompanied by the founder, community members flew to the NFT NYC event. They made their way to Pubkey, an OG Bitcoin Bar frequented by… you guessed it, Bitcoiners. Once there, they began handing out as many frogs as they could. They sat beside interested users, going so far as to help them set up an Xverse wallet (a Bitcoin wallet that supports Ordinals). And they managed to gift hundreds of frogs inside a week.

[Bitcoin Boos]
Bitcoin Boos is a collection of 101 unique characters named 'Boos', which are cute. 48x48 pixel characters that vary in species, such as dragon, dog, god, humanoid, etc. Boos live in the Bitcoin blockchain itself. Their home is on Block 775087 and they live in the grand, elegant civilization named "The Boo Kingdom" The very first Boo to be inscribed is the Boo King, Bootoshi, on Block 775087. Each boo is super strong and each one is an important contributor to the kingdom. The Boos are immortal, so while they can die they simply just respawn back at home base as if nothing has happened. They also have a collection of 35 uncommons sats inscribed in the sub 200 uncommon range called the ‘Boottalion’

Bitcoin Boos Genesis are inscribed in the number range of #3314-#14274

[Ordinal Punks]
Ordinal Punks inscribed by artist Flowstay are the first fully inscribed sub1k PFP collection consisting of 100 unique digital artifacts ranging from inscription numbers 407-642. Ordinal Punks were inscribed on January 31st 2023 and the first sales of Ordinal Punks took place on February 1st 2023 with a mint price of 0.01 BTC.
On February 3rd NFTmino creates the Ordinal Punks spreadsheet which was the first instance of a collection using a spreadsheet to facilitate and track secondary market sales. https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1_a690MxZUFGMnvU8VkchH1wLUxUQKdTbJpF9geBpHqI/edit
On February 7th the collection graphic is inscribed by 888bit at inscription #10790
On February 10th Ordinal Punk #41 is purchased for 11.5 BTC making it the highest all-time inscription sale still holding that record to date.
On February 11th Tropofarmer inscribes Ordinal Punk metadata in JSON format at inscription #58665
On February 16th 2023 Ordinal Punk #49 is traded for Fidenza #802
On February 19th 2023 Ordinal Punk 16 is traded for Cryptopunk 4155
Punk Wars was a race to be the first punks collection on bitcoin between Ordinal Punks and Punks on Bitcoin. Punks on Bitcoin inscribed the first digital artifact of their 100-piece collection at inscription #406 beating Ordinal Punks by 1 space as the first Ordinal Punk was inscribed at #407. Ordinal Punks ultimately won out as the entire collection was inscribed first and in the first 1,000 inscriptions. Punks on Bitcoin suffered an unfortunate setback as a number of the original inscriptions were sent to a Binance address which forced Punktoshi to reinscribe the lost pieces.
