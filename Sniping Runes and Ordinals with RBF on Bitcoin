**RBF on BTC and Sniping Runes & Ordinals**

Many of you have likely encountered situations where someone accidentally lists their Ordinals for a much lower price than intended. This could be a golden opportunity to flip the Ordinals for a quick profit. You confirm the purchase on Magic Eden, expecting the inscription (the data attached to the Bitcoin) to land in your wallet, securing your profit.

However, after the transaction confirms, you discover that the inscription isn't in your wallet, while someone else has snatched it and is already reselling it. You might think it's a Magic Eden bug and move on. But what really happened, and how can you potentially outmaneuver others like yourself?

**Explanation of RBF (Replace-By-Fee):**

RBF stands for Replace-By-Fee. It's a mechanism in Bitcoin that allows users to replace a low-fee transaction with a new one containing a higher fee. This essentially pushes your transaction ahead in the queue, incentivizing miners to confirm it faster.

**How RBF is Used for Sniping:**

In the scenario described, someone might be using RBF to "snipe" your Ordinals purchase. Here's how it works:

1. You see a low-priced Ordinals listing and confirm the purchase on Magic Eden.
2. Your transaction goes into the Bitcoin mempool (a waiting area for transactions).
3. The seller notices the mistake and uses RBF to create a new transaction with a higher fee for the same Ordinals.
4. Miners prioritize the seller's new transaction due to the higher fee, confirming it first.
5. Your original transaction gets stuck in the mempool and eventually times out, leaving you empty-handed.

**How to Avoid Getting Sniped:**

Unfortunately, there's no foolproof way to prevent RBF sniping entirely. However, here are some tips to minimize the risk:

- Use wallets that support Optional RBF (Opt-in RBF). This allows you to choose whether miners can replace your transaction with a higher fee.
- Set higher transaction fees when buying Ordinals, especially for desirable listings.
- Be aware of the potential for RBF sniping and act quickly when confirming low-priced Ordinals purchases.
