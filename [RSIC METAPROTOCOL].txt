  description: Key points about the RSIC Metaprotocol.
  details:
    - The RSIC Metaprotocol revolves around 21,000 unique digital assets called Rune Specific Inscription Circuits (RSICs), which were airdropped to select Bitcoin Ordinals enthusiasts.
    - RSICs enable holders to "mine runes" by matching symbols on the RSIC with the latest Bitcoin block hash, accumulating rewards until the Bitcoin halving event in April 2024.
    - At the halving, a raffle will distribute 21 billion rune tokens among RSIC holders, proportional to their rune mining yields.
    - Each RSIC traces its lineage to an early Bitcoin inscription, creating a connection to the blockchain's history.
    - The project blends cryptography, gamification, and an industrial lore narrative around rune mining.

value_and_trading:
  description: Value and trading of RSICs.
  details:
    - Initially, each RSIC had an open market value of around 0.12 BTC (approximately $5,434 at the time of the airdrop).
    - RSICs can be bought and traded on NFT marketplaces like Magic Eden and OKX.
    - Their value lies in the potential rewards from rune mining and the upcoming raffle at the Bitcoin halving.

  details:
    rune_specific_inscription_circuits:
      - 21,000 unique digital assets called Rune Specific Inscription Circuits (RSICs) were airdropped to select Bitcoin Ordinals enthusiasts.
      - Each RSIC bears runic symbols and traces its lineage to an early Bitcoin inscription, connecting it to the blockchain's history.
    rune_mining:
      - RSICs enable holders to "mine runes" by matching the symbols on their RSIC with the latest Bitcoin block hash.
      - The more matches between the RSIC symbols and the block hash, the higher the rune mining yield.
      - Holders accumulate rune mining rewards until the Bitcoin halving event in April 2024.
    halving_raffle_and_rewards:
      - At the Bitcoin halving in April 2024, a raffle will distribute 21 billion rune tokens among RSIC holders.
      - The distribution will be proportional to each holder's rune mining yield from their RSICs.
      - The rune tokens may have future utility within the Ordinals protocol, though their exact use case is yet to be determined.
    trading_and_value:
      - Initially, each RSIC had an open market value of around 0.12 BTC (approximately $5,434 at the time of the airdrop).
      - RSICs can be bought and traded on NFT marketplaces like Magic Eden and OKX.
      - Their value lies in the potential rewards from rune mining and the upcoming raffle at the Bitcoin halving.

narrative:

  details:
    - Each RSIC is a digital artifact inscribed with runic symbols, reminiscent of mystical artifacts from an industrial age.
    - The RSICs trace their lineage back to early Bitcoin inscriptions, creating a tangible link between the new project and the foundational elements of Bitcoin's history.
    - This connection underscores the project's reverence for the blockchain's legacy while charting a course towards innovative future applications.
    - RSIC holders can "mine runes" by matching the symbols on their RSIC with the latest Bitcoin block hash, accumulating rewards until the Bitcoin halving event in April 2024.
    - At the halving, a raffle will distribute 21 billion rune tokens among RSIC holders, proportional to their rune mining yields.
    - The project's narrative is steeped in an industrial lore that ties the digital artifacts to the ever-advancing march of the Bitcoin blockchain.
    - The mechanics of rune mining with RSICs blend cryptography and lore, adding a dynamic layer of engagement for RSIC holders.
    - The project encapsulates a complex strategy involving decisions on holding or selling, the future utility of runes, and the evolving functionalities within the Ordinals protocol.

differentiation:
  description: How the RSIC Metaprotocol differs from other NFT projects.
  details:
    - Unique Yield Farming Mechanics: RSICs enable holders to "mine runes" by matching symbols on the RSIC with the latest Bitcoin block hash, accumulating rewards until the Bitcoin halving event in April 2024.
    - Narrative and Lore: The RSIC Metaprotocol has a rich narrative that ties the digital artifacts to the history and evolution of the Bitcoin blockchain.
    - Airdrop Distribution: The initial distribution of RSICs happened through an airdrop to active participants in the Bitcoin Ordinals space, rather than a public mint.
    - Exclusive Reliance on Bitcoin Ordinals: The RSIC Metaprotocol is built entirely on the Bitcoin blockchain using the Ordinals protocol, unlike most NFT projects that utilize Ethereum or other blockchains.
    - Potential Rewards and Raffle: At the Bitcoin halving in April 2024, a raffle will distribute 21 billion rune tokens among RSIC holders, proportional to their rune mining yields.

benefits_for_artists_collectors:
  description: Benefits for artists and collectors in the Bitcoin Ordinals space.
  details:
    for_artists:
      - The project provides a platform for artists to showcase their work and connect with a global audience through the creation of unique RSICs.
      - By inscribing their art directly onto the Bitcoin blockchain using the Ordinals protocol, artists can create scarce digital assets that are verifiable and immutable.
      - Participating in the RSIC Metaprotocol allows artists to be part of a novel and innovative project that is generating significant interest in the crypto community.
    for_collectors:
      - Owning an RSIC offers collectors the opportunity to participate in the project's yield farming mechanics, where they can "mine runes" by matching symbols on their RSIC with Bitcoin block hashes.
      - The prospect of a raffle at the Bitcoin halving event in April 2024, which will distribute 21 billion rune tokens among RSIC holders proportional to their mining yields, adds an exciting incentive for collectors to participate.
      - RSICs have the potential to appreciate in value, as evidenced by their initial open market price of around 0.12 BTC (approximately $5,434) per RSIC at the time of the airdrop.
      - Collecting RSICs allows enthusiasts to be part of a unique and innovative project that is pushing the boundaries of what is possible with Bitcoin Ordinals.

ownership_and_authenticity:
  description: Ensuring ownership and authenticity for collectors.
  details:
    - Blockchain-based Ownership: RSICs are inscribed directly onto the Bitcoin blockchain using the Ordinals protocol, ensuring that ownership is recorded on the immutable public ledger. This blockchain-based ownership provides collectors with verifiable proof of their RSIC holdings, which cannot be altered or disputed.
    - Scarcity and Exclusivity: The RSIC Metaprotocol consists of only 21,000 unique digital assets, making each one scarce and valuable. The initial distribution of RSICs happened through a selective airdrop to active participants in the Bitcoin Ordinals space, adding to the exclusivity of ownership.
    - Traceability and Provenance: Each RSIC traces its lineage back to an early Bitcoin inscription, creating a tangible link between the new project and the foundational elements of Bitcoin's history. This provenance adds to the value and significance of owning an RSIC, as collectors can be confident in the authenticity and history of their digital asset.
    - Transferability and Liquidity: RSICs can be bought, sold, and traded on secondary marketplaces like OKX, providing collectors with the ability to transfer ownership and realize the value of their holdings. The active trading of RSICs on these platforms ensures that ownership can be easily transferred between collectors.
